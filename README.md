# Corvus
Discord bot "Corvus" for the Ravens in Black gaming guild.\
[Ravens in Black website](https://ravens-in-black.herokuapp.com/ "Ravens in Black")

#### This repository
Corvus-Public is, as the name implies, the public face of Corvus' development.\
What that means is that the actual source code isn't in this repository.

#### What is the use of this, then?\
Simply put, it's to collect feedback, bug reports and to make the development public to everyone, to enable more transparency.

## State
###### TL;DR: Atrocious
As it stands currently, this reposity contains a completely broken collection of code pieces.

Since this is to become the second major version of Corvus, v2.0.0 will be the version number when all this mess has been cleared up and reorganized into a fully working Discord bot with new and vastly improved features compared to its predecessor.\
Until then, v1.9.x will be used as more polish and features are added.

## Roadmap
###### Last update: 11.13.2020

### Fun stuff
- Achievements part II
- Squads page
- Dashboard updates (and fixes)
- News page
- Referral program part 2

### Boring stuff
- Actually fix this iteration of the bot
- Consolidation of the structure
- Corvus: Welcome bot
- Roblox verification (maybe not)
- More admin commands
- Rearrange the command permissions (with a new bot admin level)
- Target members without pinging
